/**
 * @fileOverview AI flows for the external servers page.
 */
// This file is intentionally created to eventually house the flows from `servers/actions.ts`
// for better organization, but for now, it serves to ensure the dev server picks them up.
// The actual logic is currently in `src/app/servers/actions.ts` and will be moved here
// in a future refactoring step.
